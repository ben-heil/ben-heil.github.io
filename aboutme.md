# Background
I'm a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania within the Genomics and Compuatational Biology graduate group.
I got my undergrad degree in bioinformatics from Baylor University while drinking Dr. Pepper floats and watching the bears.

# Research
My current research project is centered around [taking advantage of publicly available gene expression data with transfer learning](https://github.com/greenelab/whistl).

In general, I'm interested in understanding the conditions under which information transfers between problems.
The current paradigm of training a single model per problem has many applications, but doesn't appear to be how humans go about learning.

# Hobbies
I enjoy running along the Schuylkill River trail in Philly, and am currently training up to a marathon distance.
I'm also a moderately competitive Smash Bros Ultimate player, a mostly retired swimmer, and a decent bass 2 singer.
