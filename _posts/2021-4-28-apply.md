# Intro
When I applied to grad schools I spent a lot of time mistakes I could have avoided had I known more about the process.
This post is my attempt to help people in the same situation I was be more efficient and spend less time stressing in an already hectic season of their life. "TODO Convert this to second person" 

## Table of Contents

## Should You Apply to a PhD
Before you apply to a PhD, you should think about whether you really want to do a PhD rather than just liking the idea of doing a PhD.
I wrote about this at length in the previous posts, [Why You Shouldn't Do a PhD](TODO) and [Why You Should Do a PhD](TODO).
In summary, you should do a PhD if you want the freedom to work on difficult problems with uncertain solutions, and are willing to accept the financial and mental difficulties of doing so.


## Terms to Know
- Umbrella program - Umbrella programs combine a number of fields into one department, to promote interdisciplinary work.
Depending on where you apply, you may end up applying to an umbrella program rather than one specific to computational biology. 
One example of what this looks like in real life can be [found here](https://cbb.yale.edu/graduate-program).

- PI - Short for Principal Investigator. Not all research is done in academic labs, so not all lead researchers are professors. The term PI is used to be more inclusive[^funding].

- CV - Short for _curriculum vitae_. Academics use "CV" instead of "resume" to impress people with their knowledge of Latin[^latin].

- Other names for computational biology - If you're like me and you are going to google keywords to see which programs are out there, should should also try the following:
bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, genomics, systems biology.
There are differences between these fields, but they are subtle.
If you don't already know what those differences are, you may [find interesting research](TODO link where to apply section) in those fields that you wouldn't find by just searching computational biology.

## Getting Research Experience
If you're going to apply to a PhD, you should probably have some previous research experience.
Frequently you can do projects at your undergrad, but if you're attending a smaller university or one that isn't research-focused, it can be hard to find a computational biology research project that interests you.
If you can't find a project you like, or you decide to do a PhD late on in your undergrad carreer, you still have options.

### Summer Internships
As an undergrad student you can get paid research internships working in a lab for a summer.
In my (biased) opinion, the [NIH summer internship program](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/sip) is great because of the huge variety of research that goes on at the NIH.

There are also summer internship programs hosted by universities though.
[PathwaysToScience's List](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=TEC-Bioinformatics_Bioinformatics%20*%20Genomics#Undergraduate%20Students) is a good place to start, though isn't comprehensive.
Some search terms you'll want to try are REU, SURF, and SURP (short for research experience for undergraduates, summer undergraduate research fellowship, and summer undergraduate research program respectively).

### Postbacs
You are typically not eligible to do REUs/SURFs if your program would start after you graduate undergrad, but some may allow it.
There is a similar type of program called a postbac (short for Postbaccalaureate Research Program).
These are typically paid positions lasting one or two years that are designed to prepare you for grad school.
The NIH [has several](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) of these positions, and [some universities](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=TEC-Bioinformatics_Bioinformatics%20*%20Genomics#Post-Baccalaureate) host them too.

### Master's Degrees
Postbacs assume you already have enough of a background in the relevant coursework that you'll be jumping into an existing lab and doing research pretty quickly.
However, lots of people do pure biology coursework in their undergrad and want to focus more on computational analysis in grad school (or vice versa).
If that describes you, it may be helpful to do a Master's degree in the field you want to go into.
You shouldn't think that a Master's is required though.
Computational biology programs frequently have people apply with entirely biological or computational backgrounds.

### Working for a Lab

You could also look for jobs working in a lab you want to apply to.
Working as a research analyst/lab technician in a lab may be helpful, as you'll get an idea of exactly what the day-to-day research life looks like.

You can also volunteer to help with research in a lab.
Getting a volunteer position in a particular lab is probably easier than getting a paid one, since you'd have to apply at the same time that lab is hiring.
That being said, I hesitate to recommend volunteering.
You have skills that are worth money, and there is enough unpaid work going on in academia as it is.

## Timeline
The PhD admissions cycle occurs yearly, and has three main parts: applications, interviews, and decisions.


### Decide Where To Apply
Read (or skim) papers about problems you find interesting
Take note of the institutions of authors doing the research
Apply to places with ~3+ PIs you're interested in working with

### Apply
Deadline typically Dec. 1

### Interview
Late January to mid-March depending on the school

### Decide Where to Attend
From schools to students - rolling, typically a few weeks after interviews
From students to schools - April 15

## Finances
PhD programs in comp bio will pay you money (but not much) to do research.

## Application Materials
- The goal of admissions committees is to determine whether you can do research, and whether you will be a good fit in their program.
You application components should be 

- Application portions in order of importance -> rec letters, personal statement, cv, everything else

### Rec Letters
Rec letters 
Link to a good rec letter guide

### Personal Statement
In computational biology especially, people apply 

### CV

### The GRE
Lots of places don't require the GRE anymore; check with the programs you're applying to before you shell out the money to take it.


## Other considerations
There is a website named after a place to consume coffee that discusses grad school admissions. 
For your mental health I recommend never going there (this recommendation is so strong that I've avoided typing out their name). 

You will get rejected (a lot).

## Alternatives
If you don't get in to your favorite school, can't apply this cycle, or just want to wait a bit, you can still do research.

## Application Mistakes
- Lots of articles online will encourage you to email professors who you want to work with during the application process.
Don't do this (or at least to expect it to factor into your admission chances)
- I applied to five schools, which was probably too few. 

### Further Reading
- I worked from [this timeline](https://www.princetonreview.com/grad-school-advice/application-timeline) when I was doing applications.
It places too much emphasis on the GRE (especially now that many places don't require it) and you should probably be researching grad schools before May of your application year, but the points like getting your transcripts and recommendation letters squared away a few months in advance are good.

### Footnotes
[^compbio]: For now. Just like math is [unreasonably effective](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf) in biology, I imagine biological analyses will be [increasingly computational](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050) going forward. I expect we will get to a point where the "computational" part of "computational biology" will be seen as redundant, and programs will be split by subject matter. There isn't a PhD program in "biology, but with microscopes," so it's strange that there are many for "biology, but with computers".
[^funding]: Technically PI also has a financial dimension in that it denotes the person who is [receiving the grant funds for a project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator).
[^latin]: For the same reason we say "et al." instead of "and others", "corrigendum" instead of "correction", and "academia" instead of ["those trees where Plato taught back in the day"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/academia)
