# Intro
When I applied to grad schools I spent a lot of time mistakes I could have avoided had I known more about the process.
This post is my attempt to help people in the same situation I was be more efficient and spend less time stressing in an already hectic season of their life. [//]: # "TODO Convert this to second person" 

## Table of Contents

## Should You Apply to a PhD
Opportunity cost (if you want to go into an industy CS position after you graduate you're probably losing money)

Don't apply because you expect it to be like six more years of undergrad

Do apply because you want a large amount of freedom to work on interesting questions in comp bio

## Terminology
Umbrella program
Funded PhD Position
PI 
CV - Short for _curriculum vitae_. Academics use this instead of resume to impress people with their knowledge of Latin[^latin] 

## Timing
The PhD admissions cycle occurs yearly, and has three main parts: applications, interviews, and decisions.

### Applications
Deadline typically Dec. 1

### Interviews
Late January to mid-March depending on the school

### Decisions
From schools to students - rolling, typically a few weeks after interviews
From students to schools - April 15


## Where to Apply
Read (or skim) papers about problems you find interesting
Take note of the institutions of authors doing the research
Apply to places with ~3+ PIs you're interested in working with

## Finances
PhD programs in comp bio will pay you money (but not much).

## How to apply
- The goal of admissions committees is to determine whether you can do research, and whether you will be a good fit in their program.
You application components should be 

- Application portions in order of importance -> rec letters, personal statement, cv, everything else

### Rec Letters
Rec letters 
Link to a good rec letter guide

### Personal Statement
In computational biology especially, people apply 

### CV

### The GRE
Lots of places don't require the GRE anymore; check with the programs you're applying to before you shell out they money to take it.


## Other considerations
There is a website named after a place to consume coffee that discusses grad school admissions. 
For your mental health I recommend never going there (this recommendation is so strong that I've avoided typing out their name). 

You will get rejected (a lot).

## Alternatives
If you don't get in to your favorite school, can't apply this cycle, or just want to wait a bit, you can still do research.
Postbacc programs

Lab techs/research staff/

## Bad Advice I followed
- Lots of articles online will encourage you to email professors who you want to work with during the application process.
Don't do this (or at least to expect it to factor into your admission chances)

## Footnotes
[^latin]: For the same reason we say 'et al.' instead of 'and others', 'corrigendum' instead of 'correction', and 'academia' instead of '[those trees where Plato taught back in the day](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/academia)
