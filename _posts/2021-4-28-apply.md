# Intro
The process of applying to computational biology PhD programs is surprisingly opaque.
You can google "how to apply to PhD programs," and you'll get a number of responses.
However, a surprising amount of the advice is too abstract ("be true to yourself") or not applicable to computational biology programs("ask professors whether they have openings in their lab").
In this post I hope to pull together the good advice I've read or learned along the way, and combine all the information together in one place.

As always, comments, questions, concerns, and glaring holes in the post [can be directed to my Twitter](https://twitter.com/autobencoder).

## Table of Contents

## Should You Apply to a PhD
Before you apply to a PhD, you should think about whether you really want to do a PhD rather than just liking the idea of doing a PhD.
I wrote about this at length in the previous posts, [Why You Shouldn't Do a PhD](TODO) and [Why You Should Do a PhD](TODO).
In summary, you should do a PhD if you want the freedom to work on difficult problems with uncertain solutions, and are willing to accept the financial and mental difficulties of doing so.


## Terms to Know
- PI - Short for Principal Investigator. Not all research is done in academic labs, so not all lead researchers are professors. The term PI is used to be more inclusive[^funding].

- CV - Short for _curriculum vitae_. Academics use "CV" instead of "resume" to impress people with their knowledge of Latin[^latin].

- Umbrella program - Umbrella programs combine a number of fields into one department, to promote interdisciplinary work.
Depending on where you apply, you may end up applying to an umbrella program rather than one specific to computational biology. 
One example of what this looks like in real life can be [found here](https://cbb.yale.edu/graduate-program).

- Other names for computational biology - If you're like me and you are going to google keywords to see which programs are out there, should should also try the following:
bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, genomics, systems biology.
There are differences between these fields, but they are subtle.
If you don't already know what those differences are, you may [find interesting research](TODO link where to apply section) in those fields that you wouldn't find by just searching computational biology.

## Getting Research Experience
If you're going to apply to a PhD, you should probably have some previous research experience.
Frequently you can do projects at your undergrad, but if you're attending a smaller university or one that isn't research-focused, it can be hard to find a computational biology research project that interests you.
If you can't find a project you like, or you decide to do a PhD late on in your undergrad career, you still have options.

#### Summer Internships
As an undergrad student you can get paid research internships working in a lab for a summer.
In my (biased) opinion, the [NIH summer internship program](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/sip) is great because of the huge variety of research that goes on at the NIH.

There are also summer internship programs hosted by universities though.
[PathwaysToScience's List](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=TEC-Bioinformatics_Bioinformatics%20*%20Genomics#Undergraduate%20Students) is a good place to start, though isn't comprehensive.
Some search terms you'll want to try are REU, SURF, and SURP (short for research experience for undergraduates, summer undergraduate research fellowship, and summer undergraduate research program respectively).

#### Postbacs
You are typically not eligible to do REUs/SURFs if your program would start after you graduate undergrad, but some may allow it.
There is a similar type of program called a postbac (short for Postbaccalaureate Research Program).
These are typically paid positions lasting one or two years that are designed to prepare you for grad school.
The NIH [has several](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) of these positions, and [some universities](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=TEC-Bioinformatics_Bioinformatics%20*%20Genomics#Post-Baccalaureate) host them too.

#### Master's Degrees
Postbacs assume you already have enough of a background in the relevant coursework that you'll be jumping into an existing lab and doing research pretty quickly.
However, lots of people do pure biology coursework in their undergrad and want to focus more on computational analysis in grad school (or vice versa).
If that describes you, it may be helpful to do a master's degree in the field you want to go into.
You shouldn't think that a master's is required though.
Computational biology programs frequently have people apply with entirely biological or computational backgrounds.

#### Working for a Lab

You could also look for jobs working in a lab you want to apply to.
Working as a research analyst or lab technician in a lab may be helpful, as you'll get an idea of exactly what the day-to-day research life looks like.

You can also volunteer to help with research in a lab.
Getting a volunteer position in a particular lab is probably easier than getting a paid one, since you'd have to apply at the same time that lab is hiring to get a paid position.
That being said, I hesitate to recommend volunteering.
You have skills that are worth money, and there is enough unpaid work going on in academia as it is.

## Deciding Where to Apply
I didn't have any idea of where I wanted to do a PhD until pretty late in my undergrad career.
I knew I wanted to do research in applying machine learning to biology, but didn't know what schools actually did that research.
At first I tried looking at professors' websites, but they're pretty vague and almost uniformly out of date.
Eventually I bit the bullet and followed the unanimous recommendation of the internet to read academic papers.

#### Reading Papers
Reading academic papers is a skill[^reading] that you may not have yet.
Worse, [there](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper) [are](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) [guides](https://medium.com/ai-saturdays/how-to-read-academic-papers-without-freaking-out-3f7ef43a070f) for learning how to read papers, but they don't focus on how to read papers to find schools to apply to.

Your goal is to find which labs are doing research you're interested in, not what the state of the art in a field is.
As a result, you'll focus more on abstracts and author affiliations than on results and conclusions.
Here's an example workflow of how you can find labs through papers:

1. Decide on a research topic you're interested in. 
2. Search for a review article[^review] on the topic ([Google Scholar](scholar.google.com/) or [other academic search engines](https://paperpile.com/g/academic-search-engines/) will work better than Google.
3. Read through the article and take note of the citations to research that sounds interesting to you
4. Find the papers that you liked from step 3[^access]
5. Read the abstract of each paper to see if it still sounds interesting
6. If so, take note of the authors, especially the first and last ones[^authors]
7. Look into the institutions and labs of the authors whose research you liked
8. Repeat

Working through these papers will take awhile, so don't get discouraged.
At the end, you'll have a list of research topics you find interesting and PIs you might want to work with.
Aim to apply to universities with more than one faculty member on your list.
You (and they) don't always know whether they will have open spots when the time comes for you to pick a lab, so it's important to not have a single point of failure.

## Timeline
The first thing to know when you start is when everything is due.
The PhD admissions cycle occurs yearly, and has four main parts: applications, interviews, school acceptances, and student decisions, which can be found in the timeline below:

**Apply:**
Deadline typically Dec. 1

**Interview:**
Interviews take place from late January to mid-March.
Each school will only have one or two interview weekends, so if you get in at several places you may have to drop some schools early.

**School Acceptances:**
Schools will typically let you know whether you've been accepted into the program within a few weeks after their interviews.

**Student Decisions:**
After interview season you will have until [April 15](https://www.google.com/search?q=national+graduate+school+decision+day) to decide which school they're going to.

## How to Apply
Now that you know where that you want to apply, where you want to apply, and when you need to apply, you can start working on actually applying.
The main application materials that you'll need to prepare for each school are (in order of importance) letters of recommendation, a personal statement, a CV, and (maybe) GRE scores.

The primary thing to keep in your mind as you're putting together these materials is that admissions committees are trying to determine whether they expect you to do good research.
As a result, each of your application items should be tailored to show that (1) you're a good researcher and (2) the research that you want to do fits into their program.

#### Rec Letters
Letters of recommendation are arguably the most important part of a PhD application, though it is also the one that you have the least control over.
The reason so much weight is put on letters of recommendation is that your admissions committee will be made up of professors trying to determine whether you are good at doing research.
A strong letter of recommendation is another professional researcher (who members of the committee might even know) telling them that you are in fact good at doing research.
Accordingly, your letters of recommendation should all be from researchers[^letter], ideally ones who know you well.

You won't be writing your letters of recommendation, so there isn't a lot of advice to give here.
[This guide](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/diversity-inclusion/recruitment-2/prospective-students/requesting-letters-of-recommendation/) on how to ask recommenders to write you a letter may come in handy though.

#### Personal Statement
In computational biology especially, people apply 

#### CV

#### The GRE
Lots of places don't require the GRE anymore; check with the programs you're applying to before you shell out the money to take it.

---

## Other considerations
You will get rejected (a lot).

Fee waivers are available for several steps in the process (application fees, GRE fees)

PhD programs in comp bio will pay you money (but not much) to do research.

There is a website named after a place to consume coffee that discusses grad school admissions. 
For your mental health I recommend never going there (this recommendation is so strong that I've avoided typing out their name).

### Application Mistakes
- Lots of articles online will encourage you to email professors who you want to work with during the application process.
Don't do this (or at least to expect it to factor into your admission chances)
- I applied to five schools, which was probably too few.

## Conclusion
Applying for PhDs is hard.
Hopefully this post can save you time and alleviate some of the stress of application season.

### Further Reading
- I worked from [this timeline](https://www.princetonreview.com/grad-school-advice/application-timeline) when I was doing applications.
It places too much emphasis on the GRE (especially now that many places don't require it) and you should probably be researching grad schools before May of your application year, but the points like getting your transcripts and recommendation letters squared away a few months in advance are good.
- [This guide](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/) to PhD applications is excellent.
The deep learning/AI grad school market is different from the comp bio one, but the descriptions of the various parts of the application translate well.

### Footnotes
[^compbio]: For now. Just like math is [unreasonably effective](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf) in biology, I imagine biological analyses will be [increasingly computational](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050) going forward. I expect we will get to a point where the "computational" part of "computational biology" will be seen as redundant, and programs will be split by subject matter. There isn't a PhD program in "biology, but with microscopes," so it's strange that there are many for "biology, but with computers".
[^funding]: Technically PI also has a financial dimension in that it denotes the person who is [receiving the grant funds for a project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator).
[^latin]: For the same reason we say "et al." instead of "and others", "corrigendum" instead of "correction", and "academia" instead of ["those trees where Plato taught back in the day"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/academia)
[^reading]: I didn't believe reading papers was a skill when I was an undergrad. My opinion was "Reading is a skill, but I already know how to read". As a result I was frustrated with myself for being bad at something I'm very good at (reading) rather than something I was rank amateur at (reading academic literature).
[^review]: A review article is a type of paper that summarizes several papers from an area of research. Reviews are ideal starting points in your search because they cover many labs' science.
[^access]: If you don't have a university affiliation, you should probably be aware of Scihub. It's a website that [can provide access](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32822) to most scientific literature. Not that you should use it, of course, it is very important to respect the intellectual property rights of journals. They earned the IP fair and square by \*checks notes\* allowing the scientists who wrote the paper to pay them thousands of dollars for the privilege of publication.
[^authors]: The order of authors has meaning in scientific publications. Most author lists are roughly ordered from largest to smallest contribution, except that the last author (also known as the corresponding author) is the first author's PI, or the senior faculty member who contributed most to the work.
[^letter]: If you're wondering who you should ask, the "Understanding Recommendation Letters" section in [this guide](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/) is very good.
