"The only difference between screwing around and science is writing it down"  
-Alex Jason by way of Adam Savage

## Intro
In the strange corner of the internet where I reside, fights regularly break out over deep learning papers published by industry labs.
These papers, lacking data, code, or intermodel comparisons, are seen as repugnant to many in the DL community who live by the open source ethos.

Like many Twitter fights, the comment threads of these papers consist mainly of people talking past each other.
Individuals flock to post "they can't do that" or "they can do that" in endlesss forms most beautiful, prevented by the character limit from saying anything substantive.

This conflic exists because some expect the papers' authors to be doing science, while others expect them to be doing research.

'Science' and 'research' are often used interchangeably, which I think contributes to the confusion.
Their differences are very important though.
Science is an institution.
The goal of science is to better understand the way the world works by doing research, communicating findings, building on other work, and coming to a consensus.
Research, on the other hand, is a subset of the tasks involved in science.
Research involves answering questions like "is this possible" or "what causes that to happen."
