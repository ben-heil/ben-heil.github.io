# Intro
Designing machine learning (ML) experiments to solve biological problems is difficult because it requires expertise from multiple fields.
On one side, machine learning knowledge is required to understand the assumptions made by various model types.
On the other, biological knowledge lets the experimenter know which assumptions are actually warranted by biology and which are inappropriate.

A lot of cool science is done at the intersection of these two domains.
That being said, I frequently read papers that would be amazing, but the expertise is skewed towards one field or the other.

This article is designed to help people from both fields know what to look for in comp bio ML papers.
