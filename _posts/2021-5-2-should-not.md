# Intro
Before spending months of your life applying to PhD programs, you should first decide whether a PhD is something you actually want to do.
Any transaction that costs [six years of your life](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/statistics/all-departments-phd-time-degree-statistics) should be considered carefully.
I think doing a PhD was a good decision for me (as you might have inferred by the way I'm in a PhD grogram right now), but not necessarily for everyone.
To help aspiring grad students decide whether a PhD is right for them, I'm writing two posts giving my best arguments for and against doing a PhD and by extension the academic career path.
This post explains the reasons why should not do a PhD, and [the other side of the argument can be found here](TODO).
As always, questions, comments, concerns, angry retorts, and any relevant sea shanties should be [sent to me via Twitter](https://twitter.com/autobencoder).

## Money
There is an opportunity cost associated with pursuing a PhD.
Financially, you will be losing moeny over your lifetime by doing a PhD.
If you're coming out of undergrad with a CS background, you can go into industry as a software engineer or data scientist and make more money than you will as a PhD student.
If your skills are more biological, you could work at a pharma company instead.

As a rough estimate if you would be looking at a starting salary of TODO for CS majors, TODO for bio majors, or a $34,000 per year stipend as a PhD student.
To make things more concrete, imagine someone offereing you a $TODO-TODO check in ~six years if you decide not to go to grad school.
Sure money doesn't buy happiness, but it certainly can prevent unhappiness.
Having a $TODO decrease in student loans/increase in your net worth is a big change, especially if you're just coming out of college.
If invested, that money will continue to compound for a long time.

## Job market
Even if the classic CS/bio jobs aren't something you want to do, you should be aware that the academic job market is hypercompetitive.
If your goal is to become a tensured professor, you will have to repeatedly move cross-country and take postdoc positions just for a [~15% chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503365/) at a tenured position.

## Not Just More Undergrad
TODO intro 
It's also worth noting that grad school isn't just 6 more years of undergrad life.
You do take classes for the first year or two, but the classes themselves are different from the ones in undergrad. 
In grad school, classes focus on reading papers, designing experiments, and communicating ideas rather than learning facts and taking tests.
Grad school is also different socially than undergrad.
You peers will be from a wider age range, and will have more concerns than just what is going on at school.

## Academia is Sales
Your freedom to research what you want is a function of your ability to do sales.
The primary reason to become an academic is to have freedom on what you want to study.
As a grad student, what you research is heavily dependent on your labs focus (which is what makes picking your lab an important decision).
If you want to do something else, you have to convince your boss that it's a good idea[^PI].
If that fails, you'll have to convince a [panel of scientists](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) to fund your ideas via a fellowship instead.
If you're fortunate enough to become a professor, your ostensibly have control over your lab's research direction.
You will, of course, have to convince a [granting agency](https://www.ascb.org/careers/where-to-find-research-funding-opportunities/) to fund that research direction though.
All of that is to say that you do have some freedom on what you research, but that freedom is circumscribed by your ability to convince otehrs that what you're doing is important.

### Footnotes
[^PI]: To be fair, this is very dependent on your lab and field. 
Some labs have broad research directions, plenty of funding, and a good degree of leeway on what you can do day-to-day. 
In other labs your lab head will be more hands-on about which experiments you do and what your research topic is.
