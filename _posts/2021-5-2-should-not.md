# Intro
Any transaction that costs [six years of your life](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/statistics/all-departments-phd-time-degree-statistics) should be considered carefully.
Accordingly, you should think carefully before deciding to do a PhD.
I think doing a PhD has been a good decision for me (as you might have inferred by the way I'm in a PhD program right now), but not necessarily for everyone.
To help aspiring grad students decide whether a PhD is right for them, I'm writing two posts giving my best arguments for and against doing a PhD (and by extension the academic career path).
This post explains the reasons why should not do a PhD, and [the other side of the argument can be found here](TODO).
As always, questions, comments, concerns, angry retorts, and any relevant sea shanties should be [sent to me via Twitter](https://twitter.com/autobencoder).

## Money
There is an opportunity cost associated with pursuing a PhD.
Financially, you will be losing money over your lifetime by doing a PhD.
If you're coming out of undergrad with a CS background, you can go into industry as a software engineer or data scientist and make more money than you will as a PhD student.
If your skills are more biological, you could work at a pharma company instead.

That's abstract though, let's talk about numbers.
As a conservative estimate, I looked up Pfizer [associate scientist](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Pfizer-Associate-Scientist-Salaries-E525_D_KO7,26.htm) (an entry level bio position) and
[software engineer](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Pfizer-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E525_DAO.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=Software+Engineer%28%29) salaries on Glassdoor.
The mean salaries for the positions were $60k and $100k per year respectively[^SE].
On the other hand, a lucky grad student will make somewhere around [$34k per year](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20587/nsf20587.htm).
Over the course of your six year PhD, even in the unlikely event that you don't get a raise at your industry job, this leads to a difference of between $150,000 and $400,000.

Imagine someone offering you a six digit check, to be paid in six years, and all you have to do is not go to grad school.
Sure money doesn't buy happiness, but it certainly can prevent unhappiness.
Having a ~$200k decrease in student loans/increase in your net worth is a big change, especially if you're just coming out of college.

## Job market
Even if the classic CS/bio jobs aren't something you want to do, you should be aware that the academic job market is hypercompetitive.
If your goal is to become a tenured professor, you will have to repeatedly move cross-country and take postdoc positions just for a [~15% chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503365/) at a tenured position.

## Not Just More Undergrad
TODO intro 
It's also worth noting that grad school isn't just 6 more years of undergrad life.
You do take classes for the first year or two, but the classes themselves are different from the ones in undergrad. 
In grad school, classes focus on reading papers, designing experiments, and communicating ideas rather than learning facts and taking tests.
Grad school is also different socially than undergrad.
You peers will be from a wider age range, and will have more concerns than just what is going on at school.

## Difficulty
Grad school is hard.
In fact, it's hard for a number of reasons.

### Isolation
The goal of a PhD is to become the world's leading expert in some narrow slice of your field.
As you voyage out to the frontier of knowledge, the number of people you can talk to about your work decreases.
You begin to have strong feelings on whether the manifold hypothesis applies to gene expression data, but few people to talk to about it.
Eventually you end up in unmarked territory, seeing things daily that no one has ever seen.
Like a rocket getting further from earth, the communication gap grows and grows.
You find that to explain what you're _actually_ researching to someone, they'd have to already know what a variational autoencoder is and the difference in expression distributions between microarray and RNA-seq data.
Instead you come up with simplifications like "I teach computers to tell when people are sick" and nod sagely at the inevitable reply, "Ooh, that sounds hard."

### Ill-defined Progress
The purpose of academic research is to test hypotheses in order to learn more about how the world works.
Because you don't already know whether the hypotheses are true, you end up getting a lot of negative results of the flavor, "The interesting thing I thought might be true was not".
These experiments are still useful, because you gain knowledge about your research question, but aren't publishable results[^negative].
Research doesn't come with a progress bar, you have no way of knowing "if I just run five more experiments I'll finally understand what's happening."
You just keep doing experiments until you realize how to solve a problem or decide you need to work on something else.

In high school I never understood how someone could do something as boring and painful as become a cross-country runner.
After some time in grad school, I realized that the disconnect between the amount of time/effort put in and the results was difficult for me to deal with.
As a result, I took up distance running as a hobby, because I knew that if I put more hours into running I'd be able to see results week-to-week instead of semester-to-semester.

### Challenging Work-Life Balance
Grad student are paid a salary, not a wage.
That is to say that if you work an eighty hour week, you will make no more money than if you went on vacation.
However, the win condition for a PhD is to produce enough research in your field that you are acknowledged as an expert by your professor and thesis committee.
As a result, you end up calculating whether the breaks you take are getting you well-needed rest or just delaying your graduation that much longer.


## Academia is Sales
Your freedom to research what you want is a function of your ability to do sales.
The primary reason to become an academic is to have freedom on what you want to study.
As a grad student, what you research is heavily dependent on your labs focus (which is what makes picking your lab an important decision).
If you want to do something else, you have to convince your boss that it's a good idea[^PI].
If that fails, you'll have to convince a [panel of scientists](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) to fund your ideas via a fellowship instead.
If you're fortunate enough to become a professor, your ostensibly have control over your lab's research direction.
You will, of course, have to convince a [granting agency](https://www.ascb.org/careers/where-to-find-research-funding-opportunities/) to fund that research direction though.
All of that is to say that you do have some freedom on what you research, but that freedom is circumscribed by your ability to convince others that what you're doing is important.

## Conclusion
If I have failed to dissuade you, maybe you should [read the reasons you should go to grad school](TODO).

### Footnotes

[^SE]: I was unable to determine whether software engineer is an entry level title at Pfizer. It's possible that $100k is an overly generous estimate for a CS grad at Pfizer. However, if you're willing to move across country for a PhD you could move to one of the [many places offering more than 100k salary for entry level software engineers](https://www.levels.fyi/). I picked the Pfizer position because it's a low estimate for the type of salary you can make with a CS degree, and because its compensation structure should be similar to the Pfizer scientist position.
[^negative]: They probably should be, but publishing negative results is a blog post in its own right.
[^PI]: To be fair, this is very dependent on your lab and field. Some labs have broad research directions, plenty of funding, and a good degree of leeway on what you can do day-to-day. In other labs your lab head will be more hands-on about which experiments you do and what your research topic is.
