# Intro
Before spending months of your life applying to PhD programs, you should first decide whether a PhD is something you actually want to do.

## Money
There is an opportunity cost associated with pursuing a PhD.
Financially, you will be losing moeny over your lifetime by doing a PhD.
If you're coming out of undergrad with a CS background, you can go into industry as a software engineer or data scientist and make more money than you will as a PhD student.
If your skills are more biological, you could work at a pharma company instead.

As a rough estimate if you would be looking at a starting salary of TODO for CS majors, TODO for bio majors, or a $34,000 per year stipend as a PhD student.
To make things more concrete, imagine someone offereing you a $TODO-TODO check in ~six years if you decide not to go to grad school.
Sure money doesn't buy happiness, but it certainly can prevent unhappiness.
Having a $TODO decrease in student loans/increase in your net worth is a big change, especially if you're just coming out of college.
If invested, that money will continue to compound for a long time.

## Job market
Even if the classic CS/bio jobs aren't something you want to do, you should be aware that the academic job market is hypercompetitive.
If your goal is to become a tensured professor, you will have to repeatedly move cross-country and take postdoc positions just for a [~15% chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503365/) at a tenured position.

## Not More Undergrad
TODO intro 
It's also worth noting that grad school isn't just 6 more years of undergrad life.
You do take classes for the first year or two, but the classes themselves are different from the ones in undergrad. 
In grad school, classes focus on reading papers, designing experiments, and communicating ideas rather than learning facts and taking tests.
Grad school is also different socially than undergrad.
You peers will be from a wider age range, and will have more concerns than just what is going on at school.
