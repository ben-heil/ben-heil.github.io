## History of academic publications
TODO - Read three or four sources, cite, and summarize


## Costs of the current system
### Time
- Cite months from preprint to publication from David's paper

- Scientists are expected to review articles without pay

### Money
Scientists pay journals for the right to have them take the rights to their paper.
They then give some of their grant money to their university to pay the journals again for the right to read their paper on the journals' website.

In many journals is a privilege, not a right, and that privilege costs thousands of dollars per paper.

- UC System negotiations

### Property
#### Scientists don't own their papers

#### Not even open in principle
People who work with software frequently know that the words "can use" are very contextual.
There is tons of software that is publicly available on Github that you "can" download and use however you want, so long as you're not building a business around it.
Even in more restrictive domains like movie or music there is still an [educational fair use](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/copyrightinfo/fairuse.html#fair) exception.

Academic publishing is nowhere near that permissive.

- Chris Albon anecdote around downloading papers to read while in Europe

### Integrity

- Peer review is single blind rather than double blind, which isn't great but is hard to work around
- There is incentive for reviewers to be as critical as possible - the papers they are reviewing are likely those of their competitors, and the blinding only goes one way.

### Science
All these costs are levied against scientists (except some of the financial ones which are borne by taxpayers).
What would happen if scientists didn't have to spend so much time pandering to reviewers and could spend that time doing science instead?

Additionally, science depends on a record of past research artifacts.
If a journal's systems were to be [ransomwared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware#Growth), would they pay the ransom?
Given that it's illegal for anyone else to have copies of "their" papers, failure to pay ransom would lead to a huge gap in the academic record.

## Why do journals still exist?
- High impact factor journals act as advertisement for scientists without a strong network or social media presence
- Publications and citations are the unit of academic currency, and they are tied to promotion within academia.
- Institutional inertia
- Journals act as a filter for paper readers


## Alternatives
How do we achieve the roles above while reducing the costs?

### Debundle publication and peer review
- pseudonymous peer review (with reputation system)
- Mercenary peer reviewers (what if we paid people for the work they did?)
### Debundle publication and article collection
- Overlay journals
- Freelance paper aggregators (AK, Aran Komatsuzaki)

### What lies beyond?
Journals are a remnant of a time when scientific communication was done through words on paper.
The ideas above list how this system could be adapted to be more efficient, but the academic journal isn't the platonic ideal of academic communication.
With the power of free distribution, what becomes possible?

- Public lab notebooks (why discretize a continuous process into paper-sized chunks?)
- Interactive papers (https://distill.pub/about/)
- Automatically reproducible papers
- Video journals (Yannic Kilcher is probably the best example. OMGenomics is similar, but with a broader focus).

### Reading
- "Why is it so hard to access science? Because the modern academic publishing model is set up to be difficult and turn a (massive) profit for publishers. The goal is to make money, not disseminate knowledge." - https://nicolebarbaro.substack.com/p/failedjournals
