## Intro
The paper publication system is simple.
Once scientists have written about their science, they send their work to a company called a publisher.
The publisher then pays other scientists in [internet points](https://publons.com/about/home/) to determine whether it is worth their time to publish.
If the reviewers decide the paper is good enough, the publisher will generously allow the authors to pay the journal to put it on their website.
There is, of course, another fee if the authors want people to be able to read their paper without paying.

Historically, scientists communicated [to the public through books and to each other with letters](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p394y1979-80.pdf)
Around the 17th century, scientific societies were formed to "[share their results in person, and presumably consume alcohol](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/)"
Over time, these began to publish periodicals, which were the precursors to modern academic journals.
However, the journals we have today are largely a result of the expansion and codification of academia in the decades after WWII (read [Fyfe et al.](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p394y1979-80.pdf) for a more in-depth though fairly UK-centric description).

That is to say, modern academic journals are inefficient due to a combination of historical tradition and more modern profit considerations.
The costs of this inefficiency is largely borne by scientists, and better alternatives exist.
This post discusses the issues in the current system of publication in academia, and how they can be fixed.

## Paper Ownership
When a paper is published in closed-access journals, the journal owns the paper.
In the past, this meant that only people who paid the journal's access fees were able to read papers.
After pushback, and an [NIH mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIH_Public_Access_Policy), it is now possible to read some publicly funded research for free (after an embargo) through PubMed Central.
The journal still keeps the license, of course, so [only a subset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/) of published articles are available for future research.

Even paying an institutional licensing fee doesn't give you free reign.
[Chris Albon](TODO podcast ep) once tried to download a journal's papers to a tablet so he could spend a summer backpacking and preparing for his comprehensive exams.
As those familiar with the publishing system would predict, the journal threatened sanctions against his university and made him delete all the articles.

Posession of large numbers of academic articles will cause people to show up at your office. 
Possession with the intent to distribute invariably incurs [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) [action](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit).

## Time Costs
If all goes well scientists write a paper, submit it, wait, get reviews, address them, wait, then publish.
The median time from having a paper completed enough to submit to submission is about [five months](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.433874v2.full.pdf).
During this time the research is done and the paper is written, but no one other than the authors, reviewers, and the publisher can read it[^preprints].
As a result, the rate of scientific progress is slowed down by months.

This delay falls disproportionately on unestablished scientists.
People with a large network and frequent conference attendance might hear about unpublished results and adjust their research agendas accordingly.
Early career scientists are unlikely to have the same network or funding for conference attendance, so they have to live with an information disadvantage compared to senior scientists.

## Peer Review 
As things stand now, peer review is a system where world-class experts provide free consulting to for-profit publishing companies.
A common argument to justify academic journals is the importance of peer review as a quality control mechanism.
While the covid pandemic has [made that claim questionable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358687/), there are more systemic issues that outweigh it even if it were true[^peerreview].

At its core, the current framing of peer review is flawed.
Journals aren't trying to determine how good a paper is, they're trying to determine whether they should publish it.
In an ideal world, these would be the same thing, but in practice they diverge due to perverse incentives.

Authors want your paper to be published after one round of review so that they can spend their time doing science instead of corresponding with journals.
Accordingly, the acceptable responses to review take the form "We enthusiastically agree with reviwer 3's suggestion that we [cite their marginally related articles](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/18/3217/5304360), and have done so in the revised manuscript."
Disagreements are heavily penalized as they increase the probability that the editor will send the paper out for another round of review.

Reviwers, knowing this, can get away with recommending that the authors cite their paper.
Alternatively, they can emphasize all the flaws in their competitors' paper in an attempt to keep it from getting published.

Because reviewers have no skin in the game, it's challenging to put checks on this kind of malfeasance.
The worst case scenario is that they get reported to the journal and fired from their unpaid job as a reviewer.

Peer review isn't a bad idea, just not well-implemented in the current system.
In a world where peer review was performed [independent to journal submission](#TODO) (or after), these perverse incentives would be greatly reduced.

## External Costs
- Cost of peer review is borne by academics
- Cost of paper access is borne by universities (typically by way of taxpayers bc grant funding)
- The taxpayers who are paying for scientists to read these papers cannot themselves read the papers due to paywalls
- This isn't a niche issue. The academic publishing industry is making [tens of billions of dollars](https://www.stm-assoc.org/2015_02_20_STM_Report_2015.pdf) with [huge profit margins](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science).
For comparison, the combined 2022 requested budgets of the [NIH](https://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2022/index.jsp) are around $60 billion ^[budget].
- Because papers can't be copied and distributed freely, there is a single point of failure for the academic record. 
If a journal got ransomwared, would they pay? How confident are we in their backup systems?


## Why do journals still exist?
- High impact factor journals act as advertisement for scientists without a strong network or social media presence
- Publications and citations are the unit of academic currency, and they are tied to promotion within academia.
- Institutional inertia
- Journals act as a filter for paper readers


## Alternatives
I believe that journals provide value to the scientific community.
They provide a place to access research, they coordinate peer review, and they publicize the research of scientists who don't have a network to inform others of the work they did.
Further, I don't believe in providing criticism without alternatives unless you genuinely believe "nothing" is a better option than the thing you're arguing against.

So how do we achieve the roles played by academic journals while reducing the costs?

### Conference system
- CS doesn't really have these problems; they just preprint and present at conferences
### Debundle publication and peer review
- pseudonymous peer review (with reputation system)
- Mercenary peer reviewers (what if we paid people for the work they did?)
- https://asapbio.org/preprint-reviewer-recruitment-network
### Debundle publication and article publicity
- Overlay journals (https://peeriodicals.com/)
- Freelance paper aggregators (AK, Aran Komatsuzaki)

### What lies beyond?
Journals are a remnant of a time when scientific communication was done through words on paper.
The ideas above list how this system could be adapted to be more efficient, but the academic journal isn't the platonic ideal of academic communication.
With the power of free distribution, what becomes possible?

- Public lab notebooks (why discretize a continuous process into paper-sized chunks?)
- Publishing negative results
- Interactive papers (https://distill.pub/about/)
- Automatically reproducible papers
- Video journals (Yannic Kilcher is probably the best example. OMGenomics is similar, but with a broader focus).
- Code review
- Grant contracts - atoms.org

### Reading
- "Why is it so hard to access science? Because the modern academic publishing model is set up to be difficult and turn a (massive) profit for publishers. The goal is to make money, not disseminate knowledge." - https://nicolebarbaro.substack.com/p/failedjournals
- New science?
- "This has ... been a time of growing divergence between the different roles of academic publishing: as a means of disseminating validated knowledge, as a form of symbolic capital for academic career progression, and as a profitable business enterprise." - https://zenodo.org/record/546100

### Footnotes
[^budget]: Publishing companies' revenues don't come solely from the US, so it's not necessarily the case that 20% of NIH funding goes to publisher fees. However, it is the case that you could fund two more NSFs with the amount of revenue journals make.
[^preprints]: Sure, some people publish preprints, but in a preprint-only world there would be no reason to delay an extra X months/years.
[^peerreview]: The way peer review is often conducted also [has issues](https://theconversation.com/the-peer-review-system-for-academic-papers-is-badly-in-need-of-repair-72669), but even if they were fixed the system would still be flawed.
