## Intro
Historically, scientists communicated [to the public through books and to each other with letters](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p394y1979-80.pdf)
Around the 17th century, scientific societies were formed to "[share their results in person, and presumably consume alcohol](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/the-mostly-true-origins-of-the-scientific-journal/)"
Over time, these began to publish periodicals, which were the precursors to modern academic journals.
However, the journals we have today are largely a result of the expansion and codification of academia in the decades after WWII (read [Fyfe et al.](http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p394y1979-80.pdf) for a more in-depth though fairly UK-centric description).

That is to say, modern academic journals are inefficient due to a combination of historical tradition and more modern profit considerations.
The costs of this inefficiency is largely borne by scientists, and better alternatives exist.
This post discusses the issues in the current system of publication in academia, and how they can be fixed.


## Paper Ownership
- Journals own papers, not scientists
- Chris Albon anecdote around downloading papers to read while in Europe - 
Posession of large numbers of academic articles will cause people to show up at your office. 
Possession with the intent to distribute [is even worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).
- Monetary cost (open access fees)
- Scientific cost (can't analyze academic literature because companies own them)

## Time Costs
- Scientists write a paper, submit it, wait, get reviews, address them, wait, then publish.
Cite months from preprint to publication from David's paper
- During this delay the research is done, but not available in the public view [^preprints].
- These added layers of bureaucracy slow the progress of science.

## Peer Review 
- A common argument to justify academic journals is the importance of peer review, but peer review itself has issues
- More unpaid labor by academics (scientists volunteering to be expert consultants for a company that other scientists are paying to take their IP)
- Perverse incentives by authors (must agree to reviewers b/c they want paper published) and reviewers(anonymous and in relevant field, so incentive to plug your own paper and be negative to your competitors).
- Journal peer review is a flawed frame anyway; the goal of peer review should be to comment on strenghts and weaknesses instead of trying to determine whether a paper is worthy for acceptance in the journal.

Peer review isn't even a bad idea, just poorly implemented in the current system.
You could [just as easily](#TODO) have peer review not be contingent on journals, so the importance of peer review isn't an argument to keep paying journals.


## External Costs
- Cost of peer review is borne by academics
- Cost of paper access is borne by universities (typically by way of taxpayers)
- The taxpayers who are paying for scientists to read these papers cannot themselves read the papers due to paywalls
- This isn't a niche issue. The academic publishing industry is making [tens of billions of dollars](https://www.stm-assoc.org/2015_02_20_STM_Report_2015.pdf) with [huge profit margins](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science).
For comparison, the combined 2022 requested budgets of the [NIH](https://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2022/index.jsp) are around $60 billion ^[budget].
- Because papers can't be copied and distributed freely, there is a single point of failure for the academic record. 
If a journal got ransomwared, would they pay? How confident are we in their backup systems?


## Why do journals still exist?
- High impact factor journals act as advertisement for scientists without a strong network or social media presence
- Publications and citations are the unit of academic currency, and they are tied to promotion within academia.
- Institutional inertia
- Journals act as a filter for paper readers


## Alternatives
I believe that journals provide value to the scientific community.
They provide a place to access research, they coordinate peer review, and they publicize the research of scientists who don't have a network to inform others of the work they did.
Further, I don't believe in providing criticism without alternatives unless you genuinely believe "nothing" is a better option than the thing you're arguing against.

So how do we achieve the roles played by academic journals while reducing the costs?

### Conference system
- CS doesn't really have these problems; they just preprint and present at conferences
### Debundle publication and peer review
- pseudonymous peer review (with reputation system)
- Mercenary peer reviewers (what if we paid people for the work they did?)
- https://asapbio.org/preprint-reviewer-recruitment-network
### Debundle publication and article publicity
- Overlay journals (https://peeriodicals.com/)
- Freelance paper aggregators (AK, Aran Komatsuzaki)

### What lies beyond?
Journals are a remnant of a time when scientific communication was done through words on paper.
The ideas above list how this system could be adapted to be more efficient, but the academic journal isn't the platonic ideal of academic communication.
With the power of free distribution, what becomes possible?

- Public lab notebooks (why discretize a continuous process into paper-sized chunks?)
- Publishing negative results
- Interactive papers (https://distill.pub/about/)
- Automatically reproducible papers
- Video journals (Yannic Kilcher is probably the best example. OMGenomics is similar, but with a broader focus).
- Code review
- Grant contracts - atoms.org

### Reading
- "Why is it so hard to access science? Because the modern academic publishing model is set up to be difficult and turn a (massive) profit for publishers. The goal is to make money, not disseminate knowledge." - https://nicolebarbaro.substack.com/p/failedjournals
- New science?
- "This has ... been a time of growing divergence between the different roles of academic publishing: as a means of disseminating validated knowledge, as a form of symbolic capital for academic career progression, and as a profitable business enterprise." - https://zenodo.org/record/546100

### Footnotes
[^budget]: Publishing companies' revenues don't come solely from the US, so it's not necessarily the case that 20% of NIH funding goes to publisher fees. However, it is the case that you could fund two more NSFs with the amount of revenue journals make.
[^preprints]: Sure, some people publish preprints, but in a preprint-only world there would be no reason to delay an extra X months/years.
