title: Why I Decided to Leave Grad School

I've decided to leave my PhD program.

In some ways, this is a long time coming.
Every grad student thinks about dropping out of grad school.
I strongly considered it in the months leading up to my prelim exams. 
Eventually I realized that the pain of prelim exams aren't representative of grad school as a whole (still true), and decided to stay in.

I ask myself whether I should stay in grad school regularly, to make sure I'm spending my time well.
Recently the question has been harder to answer.

I came to grad school with two goals in mind.
First, I saw machine learning do things that I never thought possible[^progress] and wanted to be a part of it.
However, While I had some theoretical background from taking a grad level ML course, I had little practical experience.
I was concerned that if I were to apply to ML engineering positions recruiters would throw out my resume, especially since I had a [weird major](https://www.baylor.edu/admissions/index.php?id=872501) they had never heard of before.
I knew I would have a much better shot getting a spot in a comp bio or bioinformatics lab and working on ML projects while there.

Second, I had [read papers](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review) and [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRujWGpqAsQ) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYTq4QEDA78) from scientists working in bioML and believed in what they were doing.
I bought into the idea that all biology was computational biology, and that the resulting ability to scale would change the world.

I've accomplished my first goal.
I've learned enough DL to walk grad students through a full [deep learning course](https://github.com/CIS-522/course-content). 
I wrote a [three hour tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CIS-522/course-content/blob/main/tutorials/W07_Vision_TL/student/W7_Tutorial.ipynb) on transfer learning.
I've posted [thousands of commits](https://github.com/ben-heil) to projects at the intersection of machine learning and biology.
I started this blog, and I even [authored a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01256-7) on good programming practices in ML.
While I may not be as attractive a candidate as someone who has worked in ML for years, I'm well past the point of getting my resume thrown out.

As for the second, while I still believe biology will [eat the world](https://a16z.com/2019/10/28/biology-eating-world-a16z-manifesto/), I don't think I'm the person to make it happen.
I'm too far on the computer science side of the CS <-> Bio sliding scale in computational biology.
While there are interesting computational problems in comp bio, I don't find the biology part very interesting.
As a result, while I regularly read random ML papers for fun, I find it painful to read the biological background papers for my projects.

All that's left, then, is the degree, and the question of whether the degree is worth the cost.

Coming out of a computer science undergrad program, I was convinced that I had a high tolerance for failure.
Like most people, my programs didn't run correctly first try, and I was very familiar with having my computer telling me that I was objectively incorrect.
Grad school is a whole different ballgame.
In my computer science undergrad program, a hard project would mean that my program didn't work for weeks.
In grad school a project failing for years is completely normal.

Worse, the failure is indefinite. 
It could be that your experimental design skills aren't up to snuff or that there is a pernicious bug in your code, or it might just be that what you're trying to do is impossible.
You can keep trying or switch projects, but neither way has a guarantee of ever succeeding.

Banging my head against the (metaphorical) wall has left (metaphorical) bruises.
I used to love programming, and I still do when I start new projects that are different enough from my thesis work.
But if something is too similar to my thesis project, I find that I've been [conditioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) to avoid working on it.
There is a reason that I use a different IDE to write blog posts than I use for PhD work.

Ultimately I worry that if I made the decision to stay, it would be out of a fear of change.
I'm not fully convinced that that is the case, but I'm aware that I'm heavily biased towards inaction over action.
I want to change that, and the best way to start is to leave.
