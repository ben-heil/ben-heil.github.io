# Intro
This post is part two of a three part series on applying to PhD programs in computational biology.
If you haven't already, I'd recommend reading the [previous post](TODO), "Why You Shouldn't Apply to Grad School" for all the caveats this post lacks.
If you're here, it means that you've thought through the negative aspects of doing a PhD and decided that you're willing to deal with them.
Now that they are out of the way, it's time to talk about why grad school can be a great experience.

## Freedom
The number one reason to pursue a PhD is the freedom it affords you.
Every morning of grad school you get to wake up and decide what you're going to work on that day.

In industry, the work you do is determined by what is most useful to your employer.
In academia, your work is guided by your lab's focus, but you are free to start side projects that may end up becoming your main project.
You even have the ability to apply for a fellowship to get even more freedom to work on the topics you're interested in.

There is no fellowship equivalent that I know of in an industry job[^lab].
If you don't like your the team's focus, you either have to learn to like it, change teams, or find a different employer.
Even if you were to create a startup, you would still be beholden to the business's growth.
Startups may be risky in terms of execution, but they typically try to minimize research risk.

#### Independent work
As a grad student, you get a tremendous amount of independence as well.
You may end up working with collaborators, but it is unlikely that anyone will be telling you what to do or how to do it.
Through the course of a PhD you become an expert in your field, and in doing so gain the ability to chart your own course.

This isn't really an unqualified advantage though.
Different people prefer different levels of independence.
However, if getting to decide how you're going to solve a hard problem sounds exciting to you, then you're probably well-suited to the academic path.

#### Few Hard Time Constraints
Once you pass your [candidacy exams](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/candidacy-exam.html) and finish your coursework, you'll find that you have very few deadlines on your horizon.
You'll have thesis committee meetings once or twice a year and occasional conference submission deadlines, but for the most part your time is your own.
If you're a night owl, you can show up to work at noon if you want.
If you want to take a day off, you just do it.
Certainly this freedom is dependent on lab policy (and any time-sensitive experiments you might be running), but mostly your schedule says "I need to get these ten things done by next month" rather than "I need to get these two things done by Friday".

## Intellectual Difficulty
One of the things that always bothered me about science classes is that you know the answer before you run the experiment.
You "discover" that cut celery will take up dyed water or that a pendelum swings with the same frequency regardless of how high you lift it, just like your teacher told you before the lab started.
As a PhD student you do real research, where no one knows what the result will be.
Backed by your skills, your intuition, and the knowledge of the scientific community, you get to work to find answers to some of the most important problems in the world.

Finding these answers is difficult, of course.
But if you're drawn to [Type 2 Fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale) doing a PhD can be extremely rewarding.
Doing research gives the the opportunity to experience and overcome failure on a daily basis.
Very few experiments will work on the first try, if at all.
However, you eventually learn enough, get lucky enough, and build a strong enough intuition that your experiments are successful.
This "try, fail, get better, repeat" loop is not something you can find much in day-to-day life[^fail].
As a grad student, though, that dynamic is the core of your work.

## People

If you've read the [previous post](#TODO), then you know there are a number of reasons to not do a PhD.
The people who have decided to go the academic route are also aware of those drawbacks (if they weren't before they applied, they certainly are now).
Your coworkers in academia will be individuals who decided that they value freedom, independence, and intellectual challenges enough that all the negatives are worth dealing with.
That's not to say that you'll like everyone you meet in grad school, but academia definitely selects for interesting people.

## Conclusion

If you're going to do a PhD, you should go into that decision knowing what lies ahead of you.
Grad school is hard, and there are many good and bad aspects about it.
Hopefully the pros and cons are clearer to you now, so that you can make a more informed decision.
If you decide that you do want to go to grad school, I'm putting out a post in a week with information about how to apply to computational biology programs.

### Further reading/listening:
- Chris Albon [did an episode](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/04/25/should-you-get-a-phd) on Partially Derivative about whether you should apply to a PhD.
I found it helpful when I was considering applying to PhDs, so you might like it too.

#### Footnotes
[^lab]: There are industry labs that exist somewhere on the continuum between academic lab and industry position, but I'm talking about non-research industry positions. 
[^fail]: I think this is why things like sports and the [roguelike game genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) are popular, but that's just speculation.
