# Intro
This post is part two of a three part series on applying to PhD programs in computational biology.
If you haven't already, I'd recommend reading the previous post, "Why You Shouldn't Apply to Grad School" for all the caveats this post lacks.
If you're here, it means that you've thought through the negative aspects of doing a PhD and decided that you're willing to deal with them.
Now that they are out of the way, it's time to talk about why grad school isn't all bad.

## Freedom
In my opinion, the number one reason to pursue a career in academia is the freedom it affords you.
In industry, the work you do is determined by what is most useful to your employer.
I talk in the previous post about how you might have to get a fellowship to do a project outside of your lab's research direction.
There is no equivalent that I know of in industry.
If you don't like your project, you either have to learn to like it or to find a different employer.
Even if you were to create a startup, you would still be beholden to the business's growth.

## Independent work
As a grad student, you get a tremendous amount of independence as well.
You may end up working with collaborators, but it is unlikely that anyone will be telling you what to do or how to do it.
Through the course of a PhD you become an expert in your field, and in doing so gain the ability to chart your own course.

This isn't really an unqualified advantage; different people prefer different levels of independence.
If the idea of waking up each morning and deciding how you're going to solve a hard problem sounds good to you though, you're probably well-suited to the academic path.

## Difficulty
"[If you do this, it will be the hardest thing you do in you life.](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/04/25/should-you-get-a-phd)"                                                                

I'm drawn to [Type 2 Fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale), so hearing that getting a PhD would be that difficult immediately got me interested.
