My labmate [Alex Lee](https://www.greenelab.com/members/alex-lee.html) and I are putting on a virtual deep learning workshop!
The goal of the workshop is to give biologists with programming experience an introduction to deep learning methods and their application in biology.
The workshop will consist of a combination of lectures on different ideas in deep learning, and demos of their application in biology.
If you're interested, you can [sign up here](PLACEHOLDER) to receive a link to the workshop and the lecture/demo materials.

The schedule is as follows:

### October PLACEHOLDER:
**What is Deep Learning - PLACEHOLDER TIME:**  
A brief introduction to the overarching ideas in deep learning, the basic parts of a deep learning system, and rules of thumb for when to use DL.

**Basic Neural Network Demo - PLACEHOLDER:**  
A demonstration of how to implement and train a basic deep learning model in PyTorch.

**Convolutional Neural Networks - PLACEHOLDER PM EST:**  
A presentation of the potential applications of convolutional neural networks, the assumptions they make about the input data, and problems in biology where they can be useful.

**DeepSEA Demo - PLACEHOLDER:**  
A demonstration of convolutional neural networks outside of image data.
This demo shows that CNNs can be used to [predict noncoding variants' effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3547) and how to use preexisting models from [Kipoi](https://kipoi.org/).

### October PLACEHOLDER:
**Gene Expression Models - PLACEHOLDER PM EST**:  
A presentation about the motivation for applying DL methods to gene expression datak, the concepts behind these methods, and findings from a [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728678/) that uses variational autoencoders to extract patterns from gene expression data.

**Recurrent Neural Networks -- PLACEHOLDER PM EST**:  
A presentation about the motivation for using recurrent neural networks, the assumptions made by RNNs, and findings from a [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00017.pdf) that uses an LSTM to identify miRNAs.
