There is a mountain of resources teaching deep learning that are publicly available.
While they are helpful for learning specific topics, tutorials on how to implement a type of neural network are only useful if you know that that model is the right one for your problem.

In this workshop, my labmate [Alex Lee](https://www.greenelab.com/members/alex-lee.html) and I will explain the connections between biological problems and deep learning solutions.
Our goal is to give high level overviews of various ideas in deep learning and their practical applications to empower you to learn the details of applicable models on your own.

The workshop will consist of lectures on concepts in deep learning, and demonstrations of their application in biology.
If you're interested, you can [sign up here](https://forms.gle/u9aMTvuG1vpGXsDLA) to receive a link to the workshop.
After the workshop is done, you will receive links to the lecture slides and demo materials.
If you want more information, descriptions of the workshop sessions are below.

### Sessions 
**What is Deep Learning -** [11:30 AM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/62cc3f61)  
A brief introduction to the overarching ideas in deep learning, the basic parts of a deep learning system, and rules of thumb for when to use DL.

**Basic Neural Network Demo -** [12:00PM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/085db15a)   
A demonstration of how to implement and train a basic deep learning model in PyTorch.

**Convolutional Neural Networks -** [12:30PM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/18b33fa8)   
A presentation of the potential applications of convolutional neural networks, the assumptions they make about the input data, and problems in biology where they can be useful.

**DeepSEA Demo -** [1:00PM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/ed514237)  
A demonstration of convolutional neural networks outside of image data.
This demo shows that CNNs can be used to [predict noncoding variants' effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3547) and how to use preexisting models from [Kipoi](https://kipoi.org/).

**Gene Expression Models -** [1:30 PM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/9b4e8216)    
A presentation about the motivation for applying DL methods to gene expression data, the concepts behind these methods, and findings from a [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728678/) that uses variational autoencoders to extract patterns from gene expression data.

**Recurrent Neural Networks -** [2:00 PM EDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/b21f3f97)    
A presentation about the motivation for using recurrent neural networks, the assumptions made by RNNs, and findings from a [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00017.pdf) that uses an LSTM to identify miRNAs.
