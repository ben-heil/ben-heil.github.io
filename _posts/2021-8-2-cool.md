## Intro
Every year or so, a group posts a deep learning paper that does things that I thought were completely impossible.

This post serves as a living document tracking projects from the past that I thought were cool, and will collect more entries as I continue to be surprised.


### [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) (2017)

Image recognition tasks were very common around the time when this paper was published.
In fact, the image recognition hype cycle was so far past that an image recognition app showed up as a plot point on [Silicon Valley](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15582040/hbo-silicon-valley-season-4-episode-3-intellectual-property-recap).

Into this saturated environment Kaiming He et al. showed up and said "hey, we can label *all* the objects in an image, and tell you where they are."
The implications of being able to draw boxes around people were exciting, terrifying, and was one of the first projects to show that [Person of Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series)) wasn't really science fiction, just set a few years in the future.

### [CLIP + Generative Models](https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings/status/1422184376402542598)
TODO cool example images

This isn't so much a single paper as a community (spearheaded by [Katherine Crowson](kath.io) creating art by combining cutting-edge tools.
By using the CLIP model that OpenAI developed for DALLÂ·E, artists were able to create images from various generative models by supplying only prompts.
